% This script shows visual motion (rightward + leftward) lighting up subsequent LEDes
% in the horizontal arm with different speeds

%%% if jump 2
%%% 1) use the second line of three_speed and comment the first.
%%% 2) first line of RIGHTWARDS and LEFTWARDS, replace the values of jump by -2 and 2. (lines 17 and 56)
%%% 3) comment twice the WaitSecs lines 46 and 85 (comments are: wait for the central led)
